# Image Processing Program

Create a program that can read in an image file, do several manipulations on the pixels of
the image, and then write the modified image to a new file. This project will involve
learning about image file formats, working with arrays, file I/O in C and implementing
image processing algorithms in C. Some examples include:
1. Brightness Adjustment: Increase or decrease the brightness of an image by adding
or subtracting a constant value from each pixel's RGB components.
2. Gaussian Blur: Blur an image using a Gaussian filter to smooth out noise and
reduce detail.
3. Rotate an image by a specified angle using interpolation techniques such as
the nearest-neighbor technique.

libraries used: stb (included in the source code)

GUI used: GTK3
in terminal, type 
```
brew install gtk+3
```
